# SSR GRPC Exploration

## What is this?

This is a playground Github repo for me to explore Nodejs GRPC stubs with Nextjs SSR.

Other things to explore:

- Docker Swarm deployment
- TravisCI CI/CD Integration
- ReactJS Testing
- NodeJS Testing
- CMS integration

## Does this do anything?

No, it's for fun and to learn. It just happens to be public.
